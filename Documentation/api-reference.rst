API Reference
=============

Like all good command line scripts, ``cutt`` also exposes an API for
programmatic access. The functions constituting this API are mostly
similar to their command line counterparts. Note however that slight
differences exist since the command line interface doesn't always make
sense as an API, nor is it always as testable.

The Functions
=============

.. function:: cutt.cutt()
.. function:: cutt.timetable()
.. function:: cutt.cmd_courseinfo()
