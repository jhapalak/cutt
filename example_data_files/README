Some sample data files here to give you an idea of the kind of data cutt
operates upon and the kind it generates. You can also use these to try out the
program.

timetable.csv
	This is the file downloaded from Chandigarh University's website (CUIMS).

generated-courseinfo-full-names.json
	This is the file generated by cutt without any user intervention, that is,
	when no -i/--interactive flag was passed to `cutt courseinfo`.
	The coursenames in here can be manually edited.

generated-courseinfo-short-names.json
	This is the file generated by cutt with user intervention, that is, when
	an -i/--interactive flag was passed to `cutt courseinfo`. The coursenames
	are what the user entered at the command prompt.
	The coursenames in here can be manually edited.

generated-csv.csv
	This is the file that was output by `cutt csv` when it was given
	`timetable.csv` and `generated-courseinfo-short-names.json` as input. A
	similar csv but with longer names would've been generated if
	`generated-courseinfo-full-names.json` was used instead.
