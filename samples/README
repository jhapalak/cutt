Some sample data files here to give you an idea of the kind of data
cutt operates upon and the kind it generates. You can also use these
to try out the program.

timetable.csv
	File downloaded from Chandigarh University's website (CUIMS).
	This is what cutt operates upon.

csv.csv
	This is what cutt-csv generated when given ./timetable.csv as
	input. The coursenames were interactively entered by the user
	(me!), so they don't match the names in the input file.
